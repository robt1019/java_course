I've had a go at making this as object oriented as I could.

Perhaps as a result of my lack of current ability this means it doesn't fully work at the moment...

I've split the program up into four classes:

	Stag.java is where the game is run from.
	Map.java sets up a hard-coded instance of a map with a number of place objects. Also a player object which I was trying to share between place objects. I think this might be one of things I've misunderstood. 
	Place.java houses all of the methods and fields related to places. 
	Player.java is where the code for player items lives.

The game is supposed to allow you to navigate to various locations and pick up items which can be used to escape the bike-shop.

As I say. At the moment this doesn't work fully and I'm fairly certain that it is not currently possible to win the game.
